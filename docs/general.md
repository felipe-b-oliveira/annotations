## General Annotations

### Architecture

* **BFF**: The Backend for Frontend it's a pattern thar brings a proposal when we have one backend for each user experience that we can have (web, mobile, TV, etc), on the contrary to having just one generical backend api to attend every client. This patterns remembers me of the GraphQL proposal of making easier to work with multiple frontend clients at the same time but in the BFF we separate one backend for each use.

* **Serveless Web Application**: In this type of architecture the infrastructure management is made through a plataform. Example: Firebase.
